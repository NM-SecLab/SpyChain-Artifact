# Documentation / Methodology

This section explains how one could conceptually reproduce the simulation scenarios described in the paper. It assumes the reviewer is able to download and build **NASA’s NOS3 framework** (publicly available on GitHub) and does not provide the complete malicious source code. Instead, it outlines which components were extended, which configuration files were modified, and how simulation results map back to figures in the paper.

## 1. Building and Forking NOS3

- Navigate to the [NOS3 GitHub page](https://github.com/nasa/nos3).
- **Fork** the repository. When forking, *deselect* “Copy main branch only” to ensure all branches are included.
- Clone your fork:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nos3.git
  cd nos3
